/*
Problem: Non-Overlapping Intervals (LeetCode 435)
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/description/
Pattern: Greedy
Approach: Same as the Intervals pattern version — sort by end time, greedily keep non-overlapping intervals, and count what's left over as removals.
Time: O(n log n) | Space: O(1)

class Solution {
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[1], b[1]));
        int res = 0;
        int prevEnd = intervals[0][1];
        for(int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++){
            if(intervals[i][0] < prevEnd){
                res++;
            }else{
                prevEnd = intervals[i][1];
            }
        }
